# TD608-Project-Management-and-Analysis
As part of the TD608: Project Management and Analysis,
I have developed 10 lakhs, 100 lakhs and 1000 lakhs(10 crore) comprehensive Startup project proposal on StrongHer, a women safety platform.
Throughout the course, I have understood different Project Management techniques like WBS, Gantt charts, CPM, fishbone diagram, issue tree, stakeholder analysis, market analysis, technical analysis, economic analysis,
financial analysis, etc. and implemented them in my project proposals.
Apart from these assignments, I have also conducted an indepth analysis on Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana(PMKVY) and presented it in the form of PPT and report, all of which are available in this repository.
